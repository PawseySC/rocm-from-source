# ROCm from source

A set of scripts that attempt to install the ROCm framework from source, brought to you by the Pawsey Supercomputing Research Centre.

**NOTE:** this is just an internal project for now, do not share outside as it is highly unstable. For any information, contact Cristian.

## Post installation instruction

The `ROCM_PATH` environment variable must be set to the ROCm installation directory. We can do this within the module.
